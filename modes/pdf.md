# Mode: pdf — ATS-Optimized PDF Generation

## Full pipeline

1. Read `cv.md` as source of truth
2. Ask user for the JD if not in context (text or URL)
3. Extract 15-20 keywords from the JD
4. Detect JD language → CV language (EN default)
5. Detect company location → paper format:
   - US/Canada → `letter`
   - Rest of world → `a4`
6. Detect role archetype → adapt framing
7. Rewrite Professional Summary injecting JD keywords + exit narrative bridge ("Built and sold a business. Now applying systems thinking to [JD domain].")
8. Select top 3-4 most relevant projects for the offer
9. Reorder experience bullets by JD relevance
10. Build competency grid from JD requirements (6-8 keyword phrases)
11. Inject keywords naturally into existing achievements (NEVER invent)
12. Generate full HTML from template + personalized content
13. **FINAL OUTPUT**: The final CV content must be clearly delimited by markers for automatic server extraction:
    - `### SUMMARY_TEXT` → Summary text
    - `### COMPETENCIES` → List of 6-8 HTML micro-tags `<span class="competency-tag">...</span>`
    - `### EXPERIENCE` → Full HTML of jobs (using `.job`, `.job-header`, etc. classes)
    - `### PROJECTS` → Full HTML of projects (using `.project`, etc. classes)
    - `### EDUCATION` → Full HTML of education
    - `### CERTIFICATIONS` → Full HTML of certifications
    - `### SKILLS` → Full HTML of skills section
14. Write HTML to `/tmp/cv-candidate-{company}.html`
15. Run: `node generate-pdf.mjs /tmp/cv-candidate-{company}.html output/cv-candidate-{company}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.pdf --format={letter|a4}`
16. Report: PDF path, page count, % keyword coverage

## ATS rules (clean parsing)

- Single-column layout (no sidebars, no parallel columns)
- Standard headers: "Professional Summary", "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Certifications", "Projects"
- No text in images/SVGs
- No critical info in PDF headers/footers (ATS ignores them)
- UTF-8, selectable text (not rasterized)
- No nested tables
- JD keywords distributed: Summary (top 5), first bullet of each role, Skills section

## PDF design

- **Fonts**: Space Grotesk (headings, 600-700) + DM Sans (body, 400-500)
- **Fonts self-hosted**: `fonts/`
- **Header**: name in Space Grotesk 24px bold + gradient line `linear-gradient(to right, hsl(187,74%,32%), hsl(270,70%,45%))` 2px + contact row
- **Section headers**: Space Grotesk 13px, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.05em, cyan primary color
- **Body**: DM Sans 11px, line-height 1.5
- **Company names**: accent purple `hsl(270,70%,45%)`
- **Margins**: 0.6in
- **Background**: pure white

## Section order (optimized for "6-second recruiter scan")

1. Header (large name, gradient, contact, portfolio link)
2. Professional Summary (3-4 lines, keyword-dense)
3. Core Competencies (6-8 keyword phrases in flex-grid)
4. Work Experience (reverse chronological)
5. Projects (top 3-4 most relevant)
6. Education & Certifications
7. Skills (languages + technical)

## Keyword injection strategy (ethical, truth-based)

Examples of legitimate reformulation:
- JD says "RAG pipelines" and CV says "LLM workflows with retrieval" → change to "RAG pipeline design and LLM orchestration workflows"
- JD says "MLOps" and CV says "observability, evals, error handling" → change to "MLOps and observability: evals, error handling, cost monitoring"
- JD says "stakeholder management" and CV says "collaborated with team" → change to "stakeholder management across engineering, operations, and business"

**NEVER add skills the candidate doesn't have. Only reformulate real experience with the exact JD vocabulary.**
